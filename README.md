# MongoDB

NoSQL / Relational DB

MongoDB uses collections and documents. Each Collection will store a specific type of data type (e.g. users). Documents look very similar to JSON objects - key:value pairs.

Store nested documents within a document. e.g. Book could have an author property which itself is a document which has properties (first name etc)
